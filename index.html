        <div id = info> My name is Tan Le. I am a senior at Roosevelt High School, Honolulu, Hawaii. I came to Hawaii when I was 10 years old, and because of that, I can fluently speak 2 languages: Vietnamese and English. I am natrually curious; I like to try out many different subjects in school. I have tried digital art, French, band, weight training, and coding. If I was given another chance at high school, I would also like to try business, culinary, and film and production. I decided to stick with coding because of the major I wanted to go into, such as data science and computer science. But I also like computer science as a subject. I like the way the logic works, and I'm excited to learn the many different coding languages. If I didn't like something, I wouldn't force it on myself.
